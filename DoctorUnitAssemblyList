Doctor unit assembly list:
3d Print housing/ probe heads. 8 hrs total print time per unit, can make multiple on bed
drill and tap housing
drill probe heads, sand/ buff probe heads (dremel?).
cut, debur probe tubes. squish and drill if needed
build thermocouple probe heads- bend, cut, solder thermocouples, install in probe head, glue, extend with flexible wire
If needed, heat stake probe head into tube for floating head.
laser cut lids, debur
laser cut delrin clamp
order circuit boards, final assembly (buzzer, battery, buttons if not SM verison)
program board
final assembly: install probe heads in tubes, tubes in housing, battery/board in housing, lid on, screws in, clamp screwed in. solder in thermocouples
functional FAT test/ calibration


Measured timings:
thermocouples: 45 in 2 hours
Tubes: 6 tubes cut (bandsaw), turned, and ground in 1 hour. NOT drilled. Note this will be much faster with a metal chopsaw.
drill and tap 1 housing (housing only), 30 minutes? need more data points
drilling tubes: slow, needs some thinking
assemble 5x probe head (drill out 3d prints, install thermocouples, solder thermocouples and extension wire, paint nail polish) 10 minutes each


Todo:
better print geometry for less cleanup?

Stock materials:
metal tube (2 sizes- stainless vs aluminum?)
3D printer filament- PETG or ASA
thermocouple wire
circuit boards/ missing parts
	- batterys, buzzers, USB connectors
fasteners- 6-32 and 0-80
thumbscrew
delrin sheets (or scrap)
springs
