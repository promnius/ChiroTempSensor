Doctor unit assembly list:
3d Print housing/ probe heads. 9 hrs total print time per unit, can make multiple on bed
drill and tap housing
drill probe heads, sand/ buff probe heads (dremel?).
cut, debur probe tubes. squish and drill if needed
build thermocouple probe heads- bend, cut, solder thermocouples, install in probe head, glue, extend with flexible wire
If needed, heat stake probe head into squished tube for floating head. also solder in spring and spring extension
laser cut lids, debur
laser cut delrin clamp
order circuit boards, final assembly (buzzer, battery, buttons if not SM verison)
program board
final assembly: install probe heads in tubes, tubes in housing, battery/board in housing, lid on, screws in, clamp screwed in. solder in thermocouples
functional FAT test/ calibration


Todo:
better print geometry for less cleanup?
redesign circuit board for ATMEGA and USB B
redesign cup for new plug
redesign probe tip with heat stake hole in the right place and the right size
better way to sand/ buff probe heads? worth printing at .07?
can probe heads be printed with a hole size that doesn't require drilling?
jig for squishing tube/some sort of jig for drilling tube? 3D printed? something that goes in tube as a counter force, and goes under tube to keep it level, and over tube with a hole for alignment?
jig for soldering thermocouples (laser cut)
jig for heat staking?? what would this even look like?
